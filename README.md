the project "upper echelon" ("alto escal√£o" in portuguese) wants to bring transparency to the powerful staff of the presidency and its allies.
the website shows the formers and current ministers of Brazil. 

our home has the name of the cabinets.
inside each cabinet, you find name, picture and more infos.

feel free to fork and contribute on this project.
